This is my fun little project to learn basic TS, react, CSS, Node.js, express and the use of mail catcher and mongoDB. (btw I just transformed this to use Vite instead of create-react app, and I will transform the whole codebase from JS to TS)

The project are not finished at it has a lot of bugs here and there and i will work on this when the time is suitable.
